# Array-Based Sorting Algorithms Comparison

## Overview
This project develops a system designed to facilitate the comparison of sorting algorithms by evaluating the number of steps and runtime required for each algorithm.

## Features
- **Main Menu**: Offers options to test individual or multiple sorting algorithms, or to exit the program.
- **Individual Testing**: enables the testing of a single sorting algorithm1. The system will prompt the user to enter the desired size for an array, then it will generate a set of random integers to fill the array2. The chosen sorting algorithm will be applied to this array.
- **Multiple Testing**: Compares the performance of all sorting algorithms using the same data set.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort2
